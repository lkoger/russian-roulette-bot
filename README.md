# Russian Roulette
## Project Description
The sole purpose of this program is to allow your server members to voluntarily be muted, kicked, or banned. It's an entertaining way to play a high risk game that isn't really high risk at all.  

Default settings just timeout the user for 60 seconds. If you want to enable kicking and banning, or adjust the timeout time, you can do so by `adjusting the play-roulette-config.json` file in the commands folder.

## Other Info
Boilerplate code for this program is from [this repository](https://github.com/lkoger/discord-bot-template). Additional info about setting the bot up can be found there.
